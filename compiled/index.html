We use hardware that is fun, engaging and designed to help kids get started with programming and electronics. Kids will leave with knowledge they can use at home to continue learning and creating things.</p><h2>Who should attend?</h2><p>Kids from the ages of 8-18. No programming or robotics experience is required.</p><h2>What kinds of things are taught?</h2><ul><li>Ages 8-12: <a href="http://www.snapcircuits.net/">SnapCircuits</a></li><li>Ages 10-14: <a href="http://www.lego.com/en-us/mindstorms/?domainredir=mindstorms.lego.com">Lego MindStorms</a></li><li>Ages 14-18: <a href="http://www.gosphero.com/">Sphero</a></li><li>Ages 14-18: <a href="http://www.arduino.cc/">Wearable Technology - Jewelry and Clothes</a></li><li>Ages 16-18: <a href="http://ardrone2.parrot.com/">ARDrone</a></li><li>Ages 16-18: <a href="http://www.arduino.cc/">Arduino</a></li></ul><h2>How much does it cost?</h2><p>Snacks! We ask that kids bring at least 5 BackPacks which will be distributed by the local food shelter. That being said, if a child can not meet these requirements she or he is still more than welcome to be involved.</p><h2>What is a BackPack? </h2><p>A BackPack is a Ziploc bag of at least 7 of the following items:</p><ul><li>Fruit Snack</li><li>Snack Cookies (Snackers or similar)</li><li>Juice (Apple, etc)</li><li>Granola Bar</li><li>Nutri-Bar or Cheese & Crackers</li><li>Fruit Cup</li><li>Easy Mac or Ravioli</li></ul><p>These kits go to kids who usually eat breakfast and lunch at their schools, qualifying for reduced or free lunch; and they often go home over the weekend not having a lot to eat. Thus, these snack bags come in to help them eat over the weekend. </p><p>For more information about these BackPacks see the <a href="https://www.utahfoodbank.org/backpack">Utah Food Bank website.</a></p><h2>Who distributes them?</h2><p>The local food shelter Community Action Services and Food Bank to children who qualify.</p><p> <img src="/public/images/logo.png"/></p></div></div><div class="Footer"><div class="Footer__text">We <3 You!</div><div class="Footer__social"><a href="http://twitter.com/hacksforsnacks" class="Footer__social-twitter"><img src="/public/images/twitter.svg"/></a><a href="http://facebook.com/hacksforsnacks" class="Footer__social-facebook"><img src="/public/images/facebook.svg"/></a></div></div></div></body></html>
